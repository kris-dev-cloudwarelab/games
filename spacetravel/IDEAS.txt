MUST DO FIXES
- Figure out why some dust particles or asteroids get left behind with zero speed just sitting there (noncollidable too)
Most likely to do with the generateGalaxy/
IDEAS
Its like space is ultimate freedom, but you are a slave
- Add ability to harvest planets (not destroy)
- Add roaming pirates/aliens/dangerous NPCs
- Add different resource types based on body color (brown = iron, green = zync etc.)
- Add trading hubs?
- Add progression of what you can destroy and collect
- Add enemy gradient and ultimate enemy
- Add black holes?
- Add music like jaws when something bad is getting close
- Add herbivore/predator like small ecosystem that is self sustaining
- Add random chance of asteroids hitting planets or stars
- Seed/deterministic universe generator

IDEA GENERATORS
- Review coding train videos and look for ideas!

ORDERS
- Find the closest star
- Scan a planet near that star (see if its worth the ammo)
- Harvest the planet
- Bring resources back
- Choose upgrade (speed, weapons, cargo, fuel)
- Harvest one asteroid
- Harvest 1000 res worth of planets (some colored planets have more res)
- Upgrade weapons to star destroyer
- Harvest a star
- Harvest a star in Galaxy X10Y10
    Upon entering this Galaxy the player is contacted by planet of people saying 
    - The mothership is trying to destroy the universe
    - You are a clone of the previous Android 6940
    - The last Android tried to fight the mothership and was destroyed (plant ship wreck somewhere in GX0Y0)
    
    The player must choose to fight the planet or the mothership
    - If the planet is destroyed, the player can live with the mothership and continue upgrading
    - If the mothership is destroyed, the player is left stranded with no fuel (but thanked by planet ppl)

    Regardles of which scenario is picked, the game only ends when the mothership is destroyed
