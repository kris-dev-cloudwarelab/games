Favorite IDEAS
- Nanobot NPC - flocking particles that devour planets and other objects (thus multiplying)
- Add space stations (similar to planets) that have a force field and drop energy (mini-boss)
- Mobile controls
- More weapon types, higher tiers consume energy

JP feedback
- Other NPC harvesters that run away
- Give weapon later, start with passive harvesting
- More attacks in boss fight
- More missions
- Flying and shooting should be easier
- More boss fights/sequences
- Add indication that the mothership will start shooting homing missiles
- Add a better collection sound
- Vary energy/health ratio of planets so scanning has a purpose
- Add stage 2 ballistics missiles
- Mothership shield with a gap?
- Add many NPC types
- Draw new ship
- Take planets from real NASA images

Ludwig feedback
- Gigantic laser for the final battle (cuts of a whole part of space)
- Likes the speed effect on background stars
- 10 energy does not enable the energy console (limit AND INCLUDED should brijng it up)
- Some missions can downgrade weapons for no reason (it should set level 1 only if its zero now)
- Agressive NPCs
- Shoot by holding a button instead of wheel (space on PC, onscreen on mobile)
- Dangerous asteroids
- Slight "blowback" when shooting, so you slow downgrade
- Dying should cost something res or upgrades
- 


IDEAS
Its like space is ultimate freedom, but you are a slave
- Add star destruction/nebula mechanic
- Find broken/hiding "last Android model" before you
- Resource logic. Start by harvesting passive blue commets & upgrading speed, then catch green commets to upgrade harvesting, then harvest red energy to upgrade shooting
- Add an upgrade view which shows the roadmap/paths (3 paths? Shoot, move/teleport, harvest)
--- Cool upgrade names like 
---- "Warp drive" for ultimate speed/wormhole movement (moves very quickly and can skip galaxies?)
---- "Planet harvester" for ultimate harvester (harvests from the entire star system at a high speed)
---- "Star destroyer" for ultimate shooter (destroys planets in one shot and can destroy stars/cause nebulas)

- Add rogue asteroids/commets that give extra points
- Add roaming pirates/aliens/dangerous NPCs
- Add different resource types based on body color (brown = iron, green = zync etc.)
- Add trading hubs?
- Add progression of what you can destroy and collect
- Add enemy gradient and ultimate enemy
- Add black holes?
- Add music like jaws when something bad is getting close
- Add herbivore/predator like small ecosystem that is self sustaining
- Add random chance of asteroids hitting planets or stars
- Seed/deterministic universe generator

IDEA GENERATORS
- Review coding train videos and look for ideas!

MISSIONS
- Find the closest star
- Scan a planet near that star (see if its worth the ammo)
- Harvest the planet
- Bring resources back
- Choose upgrade (speed, weapons, cargo, fuel)
- Harvest one asteroid
- Harvest 1000 res worth of planets (some colored planets have more res)
- Upgrade weapons to star destroyer
- Harvest a star
- Harvest a star in Galaxy X10Y10
    Upon entering this Galaxy the player is contacted by planet of people saying 
    - The mothership is trying to destroy the universe
    - You are a clone of the previous Android 6940
    - The last Android tried to fight the mothership and was destroyed (plant ship wreck somewhere in GX0Y0)
    
    The player must choose to fight the planet or the mothership
    - If the planet is destroyed, the player can live with the mothership and continue upgrading
    - If the mothership is destroyed, the player is left stranded with no fuel (but thanked by planet ppl)

    Regardles of which scenario is picked, the game only ends when the mothership is destroyed
